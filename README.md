# cf
CLI for interacting with Cloudflare's V4 API. `cf` is mostly just a CLI
wrapping of the [cloudflare-go](github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go) package.

## Program Design
### Auto-generated Code
It is important to understand the relationship between the `definitions.toml`
file that resides in the `definitions` directory, and the `autogenerated.go`
file that resides in the `cmd` directory.

**definitions.toml** -- Contains a hand-written definition of each command-line command, their arguments, and their sub-commands.

**autogenerated.go** -- Contains golang code that does two things. First, it creates all Variables passed to the program using the command-line. Second, it generates the command and subcommand structure of the CLI.

**definitions.go** - Generates the go code using a series of templates. It is not pretty at all, but it converts the toml to definitions of [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), which provides a robust framework for CLI tools.

### Where are the API calls made?
`cmd/root.go` has a large switch-statement where all API calls to `cloudflare-go` are made.
When necessary, this switch statement does any massaging necessary to
make the arguments from the command line fit in to the expected method signature.
