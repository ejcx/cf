# cf
CLI for interacting with Cloudflare's V4 API. `cf` is mostly just a CLI
wrapping of the [cloudflare-go](github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go) package.

`cf` contains commands to interact with almost all cloudflare product areas and
can configure almost all products in a consistent and well documented way.

# Installation
If you just want to get started using `cf` then run the following command.
```
go get -u github.com/ejcx/cf
```

If you don't have the Go toolchain you can download cf from the releases page.
